this week, I went to Lake Huron. It was cold as hell. I wish I'd have brought a coat and then a Goose stole my sandwhich. So i chased it down and beat it to death with a penny-filled sock. The goose ressurected and haunted my grandmother. She actually started to behave like a goose herself. I knew who to call...

The priest from the exorcist. I tracked him down but he only had 3.5 stars on yelp. I decided 3.5 stars was "good enough," but soon regreted it. He pulled out a flask of "Holy water" that I suspect was vodka. After he lit candles he began to sprinkle my grandma with the "holy water". It surprised me to see that grandma's skin started to melt.
