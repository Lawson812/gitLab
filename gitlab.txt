this week, I went to Lake Huron. It was cold as hell. I wish I'd have brought a coat and then a Goose stole my sandwhich. So i chased it down and beat it to death with a penny-filled sock. The goose ressurected and haunted my grandmother. She actually started to behave like a goose herself. I knew who to call...

The priest from the exorcist. I tracked him down but he only had 3.5 stars on yelp. I decided 3.5 stars was "good enough," but soon regreted it. He pulled out a flask of "Holy water" that I suspect was vodka. After he lit candles he began to sprinkle my grandma with the "holy water". It surprised me to see that grandma's skin started to melt. The priest called it a "Skin-tini". He thought it was hilarious, but my grandma's feathery goose flesh was pooling on the floor! Things got weird when the priest started collecting her melting flesh in a second flash. The goose spirit emerged from her body and flew away. I thought to myself, "maybe I shouldn't beat animals after they take my food". 

I decided it would be best to go back to the lake, since grandma wasn't in any state to protest.
