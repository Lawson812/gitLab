this week, I went to Lake Huron. It was cold as hell. I wish I'd have brought a coat and then a Goose stole my sandwhich. So i chased it down and beat it to death with a penny-filled sock. The goose ressurected and haunted my grandmother. She actually started to behave like a goose herself. I knew who to call...

The priest from the exorcist. I tracked him down but he only had 3.5 stars on yelp.
